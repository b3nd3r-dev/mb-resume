When I joined, there were was a foundation of automation but I quickly identified areas that could be improved on. Over the next 6 months my team and I worked to achieve a goal of 100% automated coverage of the test cases we were responsible for. We have achieved that goal and now are functioning as a mature development organization, evaluating new line items/features as they arise and have begun the process to modularlize &amp; externalize our environment.</p><p><br>We worked with the 3 major Linux distributions (RHEL/SLES/Ubuntu) during their Beta testing periods to verify KVM on their platforms. It was a challenging endeavor maintaining our relationships with 3 different sets of engineers, but I ended up learning a lot from the process about managing priorities and expectations for my team. Where applicable we accommodated large scale testing scenarios <strong>(involving 10TB+ of RAM or 1000+ KVM guests)</strong> which provided a unique value-add to the community, verifying the platform at an enterprise scale.</p><p><br>The DevOps framework was built with Ansible and consisted of <strong>25k+ lines of code.</strong> We approached the framework with an Agile methodology in mind by building an MVP, getting hands on the solution in order to identify the next required evolution. It is going great with over 200 pull requests merged to date, and many more new ones currently open. The power of our collaboration across the team has built in an incredible level of resiliency to the code base, setting the team up to continue to innovate for years to come.</p>', 'featured': True, 'tags': [2, 6, 11, 15, 9, 24, 7], 'achievements': [5], 'collabs': []},{'id': 8, 'title': 'Bookstore', 'project_link': None, 'short_description': '<p>A java-based customer-like application simulating an Amazon bookstore</p>', 'long_description': '<p>Bookstore was a legacy application when I joined IBM as a co-op that we already had in use in various test plans.

Still being a student during this project, I had to do a lot of on the fly learning about data manipulation and XML schema rules. Things like characters in different languages or symbols had huge &amp; sometimes disastrous implications to the functionality of an API. Books are written in many languages across the world, and it turns out supporting all of them is a challenge!

For me it was a necessity, because the tediousness of re-running builds had gotten to vast. Travis offers a free CICD mechanism hooked natively into GitHub and many of the projects I was looking at were using it in their pipelines.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Internally we had a Travis environment for x86 and ppc64le, but none for s390x. I was tasked with supporting Travis on Linux on Z and so began a month dive into the source code of Travis. With this we were able to enable a regression pipeline for the release for IBM Cloud Private (ICP) on Z, a Kubernetes offering by IBM.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In collaboration with my team lead and STSM @ IBM, Jay Brenneman, we built and ported the Travis codebase to `s390x`. Jay focused on the hypervisor end, initially hooking OpenStack up to z/VM and eventually moving to KVM on Linux on Z. Meanwhile I focused on the provisioning tools that largely make up the magic of Travis. Largely this consisted of Chef cookbooks and custom bash scripts and took some 3 weeks to get our first working build, but it was glorious.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time ever our developers were able to modify their Travis pipelines and run their builds on Linux on Z. However as they integrated the s390x builds, all of a sudden Travis on Z became mission critical to all of ICP development due to the nature of Travis and GitHub. If even one architecture fails to pass, Travis will block code from being merged into the master branch. When Travis on Z took an outage, the messages and alerts quickly started flooding in. After our second extended outage we quickly realized that we had to come up with a highly available solution for the tool.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Utilizing a load balancing feature in RabbitMQ we stood up another OpenStack instance located in Hursley, United Kingdom and replicated our port of Travis on Z to those systems. Since then we have been able to take independent outages without affecting an ever growing demand for Travis on Z.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>â€” &nbsp;Extra Info</p><p>It began with connecting the <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/worker/network/members">travis-ci worker</a> to an Openstack instance hosted on z/KVM. However we ran into issues with big bursts of builds which caused the networking layer in Openstack to intermittently not initiate. Eventually we upgraded to use LXD to run the builds which gave a huge speed increase and more portability. Using Packer I built <a href="https://github.com/bendermIBM/packer-templates/tree/lxd-templates-travonz">xenial/bionic base images</a> for Linux on Z and deployed a production configuration supporting 20,000+ builds a year. See some changes to the <a href="https://github.com/bendermIBM/travis-build">travis-build scripts</a> which also needed some configurations</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once I moved to the LXD based builds I was able to automate the deployment of LXD and the Travis Worker on a Ubuntu Bionic host using Ansible. Still using the previous OpenStack environment we could now provision infrastructure with Terraform and configure workers using Ansible.</p>', 'featured': True, 'tags': [5, 6, 14], 'achievements': [4], 'collabs': []},{'id': 4, 'title': 'NexNest', 'project_link': 'github.com/maxbbender/nexnest', 'short_description': '<p>A housing portal for college students</p>', 'long_description': '<p>I had written a couple websites with Flask in school, but wanted to learn more and read up on <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/">Miguel Grinberg</a>\'s Flask tutorial and was exposed to a new set of best practices.
